#### Goals for this Module
  [x] Complete Introduction discussion post 
  [x] Complete Studio Brainstorm Assignment
  [ ] Start brainstorming ideas for project game (in progress)

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Completed my intro
  - I completed my studio brainstorm assignment. The studio name idea is WiczWare
  - Chose my game for Case Study 1 (Pitfall 2)
- **Challenges faced**:
  - N/A>
- **Solutions**:
  - N/A

#### Learnings
- Man, trying to force myself to be creative is hard, its much easier to be doing something completely different, have an idea, and have a mad scramble to write it down

#### Free Thinking
- Things to brainstorm about for game:
  - How to generate dungeon: dungeon tiles, hallway tiles, loot room tiles, etc. with decks for each tile type. Shuffle up the decks at the start of the game to determine what tiles will go where. a boss tile goes at the end of the board. Additionally, there are is a Secret Room deck of cards, with encounters, loot, etc. on the card. These are placed in one direction only (arrow to show this)
<!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry


- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?" -->

#### Next Steps
- I think theres an assignment for me to play and analyze an atari game, and I chose Pitfall 2 (because Pitfall was already taken)
