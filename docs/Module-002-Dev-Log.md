#### Goals for this Module
- [x] Complete Atari Case Study assignment
- [ ] Start brainstorming ideas for project game (in progress)

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Completed the Atari case study assignment, Pitfall 2 was kinda fun ngl
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Am taking CS 490 and why exactly is the workload so heavy??? Wasn't able to put much time into this class for the past two weeks because of it
- **Solutions**:
  - Panic ig

#### Learnings
- i didn't know that the Atari had 128 BYTES of memory, that is crazy. those programmers must have been wizards

#### Free Thinking
- Game Brainstorming
  - Don Friar - the Prayer (is a cleric)
  - deck of cards to determine encounters, easy deck, medium deck, hard deck, boss deck (draw x from deck 1, y from deck 2, etc.)
  - use loading dice as a mechanic?
  - Mike Tythin - Fairy with a lisp (hey lithin ts) that has magic but just uses it to bite peoples ears (thats how he deals damage)
  - Kia Soul (Swole?): a transformer that transforms into a car, deals damage by doing rocket league tactics (flip resets, etc.)

#### Next Steps
- Keep working on learning frontend dev for CS 490, then worry about this class (sorry)
