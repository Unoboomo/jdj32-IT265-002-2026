#### Goals for this Module

- [ ] Complete the "What makes a Game Bad" discussion
- [x] Start brainstorming ideas for project game (in progress)

#### Progress

- **What I accomplished**:
  - done a bunch of brainstorming for my game in and out of class
- **Challenges faced**:
  - CS 490 has a huge workload
- **Solutions**:
  - Panic

#### Learnings

- N/a

#### Free Thinking

- Game Brainstorming
  - Make a trading card game?
  - doom music type shi
  - street sign weapon
  - have a button run away from your cursor?
  - basement fight club?
  - turn based punch out vibe
  - mike tyson is still the final boss
  - to make multiplayer, increase damage/attack spread and health
  - enemy turn: play flipped cards if any, flip new card to play next turn, end
    turn
  - Mike Tythin does no damage to characters without flesh ears
  - Adam Sandler: has a card called "I have a hot wife" (instead of a pass turn
    card?)
  - The rock/jason Statham/vin Diesel, maybe you fight one of them
  - when you beat an enemy/boss, you flip their card over, and rewards/further
    instructions are on the back
  - for whichever Fast & furious character i decide to use, their back is a
    contract that states they cant lose a fight, and the fight continues for a
    bit: second phase: (insert name)'s contract, only attack: "i cant lose a
    fight", health: "very low"

#### Next Steps

- Keep working on learning frontend dev for CS 490,
