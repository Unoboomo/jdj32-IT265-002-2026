## Vision Statement

> To bring games to the masses that will bring the masses to games

## Core Values

- Optimization: Many game studios have forgone optimizing their games as a cost cutting measure, leading to resource-demanding, sloppy games. I aim to forerun a new era of game development, where hardware is utilized to its fullest potential
- Affordability: Games nowadays are getting more expensive, while arguably getting worse. As a solo game studio, I strive to bring quality games to the masses while ensuring the masses can still afford them.
- Excellence: As a solo game studio, I strive for excelence in everything I make and everything I do, and that doesn't stop at the door
