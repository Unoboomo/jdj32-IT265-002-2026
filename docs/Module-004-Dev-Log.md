<!-- Repeat the below as needed-->

### Date: [02/23/2026]

#### Goals for this Module

- [X] Complete the Color Theory Case Study
- [x] Start brainstorming ideas for project game (in progress)

#### Progress

- **What I accomplished**:
  - Color Theory Case Study
- **Challenges faced**:
  - CS 490 has a huge workload
- **Solutions**:
  - Panic

#### Learnings

- Sometimes, your ideas wont work together, and instead of banging your head against a wall trying to force them to, pivot
- Photo editing is really tedious and annoying, and i dislike it very much

#### Free Thinking

- Game Brainstorming
  - Attack, block, and special move cards, each enemy card has an attack, block, and special move, and they use these moves when they play the card. 
  - when you beat a boss, you shuffle their card into your deck (replace one of the cards already in there?), and when you draw them you can play one of their three moves
  - instead of a deck of cards to determine enemy moves, roll a d6 (1/2 attack, 3/4 block, 5/6 special)
  - have additive scaling for enemies: first +0 to attack and block, second +1, 3rd +2, etc. Have special scaling every x encounters

#### Next Steps

- Keep working on learning frontend dev for CS 490, keep brainstorming for my game, start working on design treatment document

#### Goals for this Module

- [ ] Complete the Color Theory Case Study
- [x] Start brainstorming ideas for project game (in progress)

#### Progress

- **What I accomplished**:
  - Did a bunch of brainstorming for my game in class
- **Challenges faced**:
  - CS 490 has a huge workload
- **Solutions**:
  - Manage my time properly so I have enough time for all my responsibilities (no procrastinating)

#### Learnings

- N/a

#### Free Thinking

- Game Brainstorming
  - Diddy is a boss, can lather up in baby oil to increase his dodge chance (x turn cooldown)
  - KSI as a boss, rolls a d20 every turn, if he rolls a 1, he releases thick of it and sd's
  - logan Paul but he's a goblin and scams you out of your money
  - each enemy boss has a unique mechanic
  - punch out meets slay the spire meets the dumbest jokes i can come up with
  - bill gates is an poison type character
  - scaling every x rounds by y times base damage
  - scaling also based on number of players and boss progression (how many bosses killed/left)
  - when Vin Diesel dies, he summons his family
  - Vince McMahon - every time you damage him, he has a chance to do a really bad sell, and "The Referee" will come check his pulse, and heal him a bit


#### Next Steps

- Keep working on learning frontend dev for CS 490
